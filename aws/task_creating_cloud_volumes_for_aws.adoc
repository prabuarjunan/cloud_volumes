[.lead]
You create cloud volumes from the NetApp Cloud Orchestrator site.

== Prerequisites

Your AWS environment must meet certain requirements before you can create your first cloud volume. For each AWS region where you plan to deploy cloud volumes, you must have a:

* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
* Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) that is connected to your VPC
* Subnet for the VPC
* Routes defined that include the network on which cloud volumes will run
* Optionally, a Direct Connect Gateway

You must have the following information available when creating your first cloud volume in a region:

* *AWS account ID*: A 12-digit Amazon account identifier with no dashes.
* *Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) Block*: An unused IPv4 CIDR block. The network must be a /28, and it must also fall within the ranges reserved for private networks (RFC 1918). Do not choose a network that overlaps your VPC CIDR allocations.
* *Autonomous System Number (ASN)*: When using a Virtual Private Gateway, use that ASN. When using a Direct Connect Gateway, use that ASN.
*	You must have selected the correct region where you want to use the service. See  link:task_selecting_region.html[Selecting the region].

If you have not configured the required AWS networking components, see the link:media/cvs_aws_account_setup.pdf[NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for AWS Account Setup^] guide for details.

*Note:* When planning to create an SMB volume, you must have a Windows Active Directory server available to which you can connect. You will enter this information when creating the volume.

== Enter volume details

Complete the fields at the top of the Create Volume page to define the volume name, size, service level, and more.

. After you have logged in to the https://cds-aws-bundles.netapp.com/storage/volumes[NetApp Cloud Orchestrator^] site with the email address that you provided during your subscription, and you have link:task_selecting_region.html[selected the region], click the *Create new volume* button.
+
image::diagram_create_volume_1.png[Create Volume page]
. From the Create Volume page, select *NFS*, *SMB*, or *Dual-protocol* as the protocol for the volume you want to create.
. In the *Name* field, specify the name you want to use for the volume.
. In the  *Region* field, select the AWS region where you want to create the volume. This region must match the region you configured on AWS.
. In the *Timezone* field, select your time zone.
. In the *Volume path* field, specify the path you want to use or accept the automatically generated path.
. (Optional) In the *Create from snapshot* field, select the name of an existing snapshot that will be used to create a volume.
. In the *Service level* field, select the level of performance for the volume: *Standard*, *Premium*, or *Extreme*.
+
See link:reference_selecting_service_level_and_quota.html[Selecting the appropriate service level and allocated capacity] for details.
. In the *Allocated capacity* field, select the size of the volume.
+
link:reference_selecting_service_level_and_quota.html[Selecting the appropriate service level and allocated capacity]
. If you selected Dual-protocol, you can select the security style in the *Security style* field by selecting *NTFS* or *UNIX* from the drop-down menu.
+
Security styles affect the file permission type used and how permissions can be modified.
+
** UNIX uses NFSv3 mode bits, and only NFS clients can modify permissions.
** NTFS uses NTFS ACLs, and only SMB clients can modify permissions.

== Enter network details (one-time setting per AWS region)

If this is the first time you have created a cloud volume in this AWS region, the *Network* section is displayed so you can connect your Cloud Volumes account to your AWS account:

. In the *CIDR (IPv4)* field, enter the desired IPv4 range for the region. The network must be a /28. The network must also fall within the ranges reserved for private networks (RFC 1918).  Do not choose a network that overlaps your VPC CIDR allocations.
. In the *Autonomous System Number (ASN)* field, enter the ASN. When using a VGW in your AWS configuration, use that ASN. When using a Direct Connect Gateway, use that ASN.
. In the *AWS account ID* field, enter your 12-digit Amazon account identifier with no dashes.
+

== Enter export policy rules (optional)

If you selected NFS or Dual-protocol, you can create an export policy in the *Export policy* section to identify the clients that can access the volume:

. In the *Allowed clients* field, specify the allowed clients by using an IP address or Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).
. In the *Access* field, select *Read & Write* or *Read only*.
+
image::diagram_create_volume_4.png[Add export policy rule]

Click *+ Add export policy rule* if you want to define additional export policy rules.

== Enable data encryption (optional)

. If you selected SMB or Dual-protocol, you can enable SMB session encryption by checking the box for the *Enable data encryption* field.
+
*Note:* Do not enable encryption if SMB 2.1 clients need to mount the volume.

== Integrate the volume with an Active Directory server (SMB only)

If you selected SMB or Dual-protocol, you can choose to integrate the volume with a Windows Active Directory server in the *Active Directory* section.

*Note:* The AWS Directory Service is currently not supported for Cloud Volumes. You must select a Windows AD server.

. In the *DNS server* field, enter the IP address of the DNS server that you want to use.
. In the *Domain* field, enter the domain for the SMB share.
. In the *NetBIOS* field, enter a NetBIOS name for the SMB server that will be created.
. In the *Username* field, enter a username for your Active Directory server.
+
You can use any username that is authorized to create machine accounts in the Active Directory domain to which you are joining the SMB server.
. In the *Password* field, enter the password for the AD username that you specified in Username.
+

+
IMPORTANT: You should follow the guidance on AWS security group settings to enable cloud volumes to integrate with Windows Active Directory servers correctly. See <<reference_security_groups_windows_ad_servers.adoc#,AWS security group settings for Windows AD servers>> for more information.

== Create a Snapshot policy (optional)

If you want to create a snapshot policy for this volume, enter the details in the *Snapshot policy* section:

. Select the snapshot frequency: *Hourly*, *Daily*, *Weekly*, or *Monthly*.
. Select the number of snapshots to keep.
. Select the time when the snapshot should be taken.
+
image::diagram_snapshot_policy_1.png[Snapshot policy]

You can create additional snapshot policies by repeating the steps above, or by selecting the Snapshots tab from the left navigation area.

== Create the volume
. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click *Create Volume*.
+
If you have previously created a cloud volume in this region, the new volume appears in the Volumes page.
+
If this is the first cloud volume you have created in this AWS region and you have entered the networking information in the Network section of this page, a Progress dialog is displayed that identifies the next steps you must follow to connect the volume with AWS interfaces.
+
image:diagram_create_volume_interfaces_dialog.png[Accept virtual interfaces dialog]
+
. Accept the virtual interfaces as described in section 6.4 of the link:media/cvs_aws_account_setup.pdf#page=21[NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for AWS Account Setup^] guide. You must perform this task within 10 minutes or the system may time out.
+
If the interfaces do not appear within 10 minutes there may be a configuration issue; in which case you should contact support.
+
After the interfaces and other networking components are created, the volume you created appears in the Volumes page and the Actions field is listed as Available.
